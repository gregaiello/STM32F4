# STM32F4
Small projects using STM32F4 discovery board, I use KEIL + CUBE on Windows <br />
The files in the folder are just src files, in order to get the dependancies create a project with STM32CUBE with the peripherals needed in the project.<br />
<br />
1- I2C test<br />
2- Reverse engineering on the Falcon Robot by Novint to read the values from the buttons on the grip and echo the values to UART. <br />
